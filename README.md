**Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è for the travel industry** üåç‚úàÔ∏èüè®



I want us to make some improvements to the UI we are displaying when the user is logged in.
1. This word are not clear since they are in white, Lets make them black
Welcome back, Newenv! üëã
Ready for your next African adventure? Explore breathtaking destinations, book flights, and discover the magic of safari life.
2. The image on the hero section is same as on the landing page, lets find another and better image but the UI should remain intact.
3. On the sidebar, where we have the differnt services we have, the first option is Overview, this should remain as the first.
The second should be tours and everything in it. the 3rd should be hire a car, the 4th should be visas, the 5th should Flights and the 6th should be Products where we have our ecommerce shop for travel products.
Re arrange them like that, and also we need to add colors. here are the 2 company colors.
